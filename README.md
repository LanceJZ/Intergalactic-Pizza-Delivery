# Video game made using C++ with raylib.
In this game you deliver pizzas to planets all over the galaxy.
You have to toss the pizza at the planet, if you let your ship get too close, you spend fuel on escaping the planets gravity well. The gravity well will also affect the pizza, and if you don't throw it too hard, it drops on the planet. Graphic wise, the pizza looks almost as big as the moon to the planet. The ships physics are similar to asteroids deluxe.
You have to manage your money on fuel and repairs.
You can upgrade your space ship.
The faster you deliver the pizza, the more money you make.
Space pirates are also attempting to steal your pizza.
Competing companies want to stop your deliveries.
